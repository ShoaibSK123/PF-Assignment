//Grid: We call the 20x20 array the grid

/*Summary: We look at the grid in different waysâ€”side to side, up and down,
and even diagonally. At each step, we examine groups of four numbers next to each other.
If we find a group where the multiplication result is bigger than what we've seen before, we remember it
and say whether it was from a row, a column, or a diagonal. In the end, we tell which group of
numbers gave us the biggest result and what direction it was in.*/
